As a requirement for my **Grade 10 Computer Science course**, this game was developed using the [CMU Academy Online Graphics IDE](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/).  

Due to limitations of the IDE:
- The entire game is written in **a single file**.
- All images are pulled from the internet at runtime — if they're removed from the source, the game may fail to load properly.
- You can try the game here (fullscreen button in top right corner):

  ⚠️ *Note: This link may not always function due to external image dependencies.*

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Select Your Characters**
   - Use the **arrow keys on-screen** to choose your team.
   - **Hold `i`** while hovering over a character to view stats.

2. **Start the Game**
   - Press **“Play”** when ready.
   - ⏳ *Be patient — the game may take some time to load.*

3. **Win Conditions**
   - Defeat all opposing players, **or**
   - Destroy the enemy **vault**.

4. **Controls & Turn Rules**
   - Each player gets **1 move** and **1 attack** per turn.
   - **To move:** drag and drop the character.
   - **To attack:**
     - Hover over your character

     - Click on your target
   - Hover + hold **`i`** to view any player’s health and stats.
   - End your turn by clicking **“End Turn”** in the top left.

5. **Important Notes**
   - ❗ *Do not click “End Turn” twice in a row — it will skip your next turn.*
   - Wait for **“Your Turn”** (top right) before making a move.
   - When it says **“Enemies Turn”**, sit tight — the enemy team is acting.
