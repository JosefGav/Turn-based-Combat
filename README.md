As a requirement for my grade 10 computer science course, this game was developed using the CMU online graphics IDE.  

Due to the limitations of this IDE, all contents of the project are contained in one file, and any referenced images are pulled from the internet whenever they are used.

   - **Hold `i`** while hovering over a character to view stats.

   - Destroy the enemy **vault**.

4. **Controls & Turn Rules**
   - Each player gets **1 move** and **1 attack** per turn.
   - **To move:** drag and drop the character.
   - **To attack:**

5. **Important Notes**
   - ❗ *Do not click “End Turn” twice in a row — it will skip your next turn.*
   - Wait for **“Your Turn”** (top right) before making a move.
   - When it says **“Enemies Turn”**, sit tight — the enemy team is acting.
